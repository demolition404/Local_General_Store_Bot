# Local_General_Store_Bot

Note that This code will only be functional when I run my program on my laptop because it has not been hosted on any foregin servers or online hosting platforms mainly because I am a student and the free hosting platforms had a lot of dependencies to work with. So if you want to use the bot just ping me I will run the program you will be able to order using my telegram bot @localodishabot


During the project, several innovative business solutions and extra features were implemented in the Telegram bot for the local food store to enhance its functionality and provide added value to the customers. These include:

Personalized recommendations: The Telegram bot was designed to analyze the purchase history and preferences of customers to provide personalized recommendations for food items based on their past orders and interests. This feature helps customers discover new food items and enhances their shopping experience by tailoring recommendations to their tastes.

Order customization: The bot allows customers to customize their food orders by specifying preferences such as ingredient substitutions, portion sizes, and dietary restrictions. This feature offers flexibility and convenience to customers, allowing them to customize their orders to their preferences, which can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Real-time order tracking: The bot includes a real-time order tracking feature that allows customers to track the status of their food orders from the moment they place the order until it is delivered or ready for pickup. This provides transparency and assurance to customers, keeping them informed about the progress of their orders and improving their overall experience.

Food safety and hygiene information: The bot includes information about food safety and hygiene practices followed by the store, such as ingredient sourcing, handling, and storage. This feature helps build trust with customers by assuring them about the quality and safety of the food items they are ordering.

Social media integration: The bot is integrated with the store's social media accounts, allowing customers to follow the store's updates, promotions, and events directly from the bot. This helps the store build a strong online presence, engage with customers, and promote their offerings, leading to increased brand awareness and customer engagement.

Quick reorder: The bot includes a quick reorder feature that allows customers to easily reorder their previous orders with just a few clicks. This feature saves customers time and effort, making it convenient for them to reorder their favorite food items.

These innovative business solutions and extra features were implemented based on research and insights gathered from interactions with the store owner, understanding customer preferences and needs, and analyzing the competitive landscape. These features aim to provide a seamless and personalized shopping experience for customers, enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty, and drive business growth for the local food store.
